### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Client Requests Authentication**:
   - The client (e.g., a web browser, mobile app) sends a request to the authentication endpoint `/api/auth/login` with a username and password.

2. **Spring Security Configuration**:
   - When the Spring Boot application starts, the `SecurityConfig` class is loaded.
   - This class configures security settings for the application, including authentication and authorization rules.

3. **Authentication Manager Setup**:
   - The `authenticationManager` bean is configured in the `SecurityConfig` class.
   - It uses the `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` to build an authentication manager that authenticates users based on the `UserDetailsService` and `PasswordEncoder`.

4. **JWT Request Filter Setup**:
   - The `jwtRequestFilter` bean is configured in the `SecurityConfig` class.
   - This filter intercepts incoming requests and processes JWT tokens.

5. **User Details Service Setup**:
   - The `userDetailsService` bean is configured in the `SecurityConfig` class.
   - It loads user details (e.g., username, password, authorities) based on the provided username.

6. **JWT Token Generation**:
   - When the client sends a POST request to `/api/auth/login`, the `AuthController` handles the request.
   - It uses the `authenticationManager` to authenticate the user based on the provided username and password.
   - If authentication is successful, a JWT token is generated using the `JwtUtil` class.
   - The generated token is sent back to the client as part of the response body.

7. **JWT Token Verification**:
   - For subsequent requests that require authentication, the client includes the JWT token in the request header.
   - When the request reaches the server, it goes through the `JwtRequestFilter`.
   - The filter extracts the JWT token from the request header and verifies its validity using the `JwtUtil`.
   - If the token is valid, the filter sets the authentication information in the `SecurityContextHolder`.

8. **Authorization**:
   - Once the user is authenticated and the JWT token is validated, authorization checks are performed based on the requested endpoint.
   - The `SecurityConfig` class specifies authorization rules using `HttpSecurity`.
   - Endpoints are configured to be either public (accessible without authentication) or protected (requiring a valid JWT token).

9. **Access Granted**:
   - If the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested endpoint, the request is processed by the corresponding controller method.
   - The controller logic executes and generates a response.

### Summary:

- Authentication is handled by Spring Security's authentication manager, which is configured to use a `UserDetailsService` for loading user details and a `PasswordEncoder` for encoding and verifying passwords.
- JWT token generation and verification are managed by the `JwtUtil` class and the `JwtRequestFilter`, respectively.
- The `SecurityConfig` class configures security settings, including authentication and authorization rules, using `HttpSecurity`.
- Each component plays a specific role in the authentication and authorization process, and they are chained together to ensure secure access to endpoints based on user credentials and JWT tokens.
